SYNOPSIS
        bdf2bmp [-options ...] input-BDF-file output-BMP-file

        The bdf2bmp utility creates a BMP-image-file containing
        all the glyph-images in a BDF-font-file.  That BMP file
        is a kind of Windows-type, 256 colors(8bitsPerPixel).

                <number> is limited from 0 to 32.  The default

                number.

        -c<number>
                This option specifies the number of columns in
                grid.  <number> is limited from 1 to 4096.
                The default is 32.  DO NOT INSERT SPACE BETWEEN

        -w
